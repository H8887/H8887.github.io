			I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed<br>
			Get along with the voices inside of my head<br>
			You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath<br>
			And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy<br>

			I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek<br>
			Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey<br>
			Wanted to receive attention for my music<br>
			Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me<br>
			For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways<br>
			Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated<br>
			When I blew, see, but it was confusing<br>
			'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf<br>
			Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam<br>
			Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!<br>
			But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet<br>
			It was like winnin' a used mink<br>
			Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink<br>
			I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep<br>
			Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith<br>
			But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—<br>

			I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed<br>
			Get along with the voices inside of my head<br>
			You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath<br>
			And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy<br>
			Well, that's nothin'<br>


			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			Well, that's nothin'<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>

			Now, I ain't much of a poet<br>
			But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment<br>
			And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all<br>
			Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'<br>
			Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from<br>
			Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders<br>
			No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders<br>
			Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder<br>
			And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen<br>
			'Cause I need an interventionist<br>
			To intervene between me and this monster<br>
			And save me from myself and all this conflict<br>
			'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it<br>
			My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'<br>
			Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'<br>
			I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'<br>
			Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—<br>

			I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed<br>
			Get along with the voices inside of my head<br>
			You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath<br>
			And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy<br>
			Well, that's nothin'<br>

			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			Well, that's nothin'<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>

			Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that<br>
			I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian<br>
			But until then, drums get killed and<br>
			I'm comin' straight at MCs, blood gets spilled and<br>
			I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track<br>
			Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'<br>
			And shit to say back to the kids who played him<br>
			I ain't here to save the fuckin' children<br>
			But if one kid out of a hundred million<br>
			Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great<br>
			It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back<br>
			In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that<br>
			Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack<br>
			Maybe I need a straightjacket<br>
			Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that<br>
			It's nothin', I'm still friends with the<br>


			
			I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed<br>
			Get along with the voices inside of my head<br>
			You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath<br>
			And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy<br>
			I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed<br>
			(Get along with) Get along with the voices inside of my head<br>
			(You're tryin' to) You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath<br>
			(And you think) And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy<br>
			Well, that's nothin'<br>
			
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			Well, that's nothin'<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
			(Yoo-ooh, ooh-ooh)<br>
